**DocPilot** is a sophisticated, AI-augmented clinical management platform designed for high-performance practice management. Built for two distinct user roles — **Doctors** and **Patients** — it digitalises the entire outpatient workflow: from appointment booking and OPD queue management, through live chat consultations and prescription creation, to file storage, analytics, and billing.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

DocPilot uses a hybrid cloud architecture for maximum reliability and regulatory compliance:

    A[React 19 Frontend] --> B[Firebase Auth]
    A --> C[Cloud Firestore]
    A --> D[Appwrite Storage]
    A --> E[Google Gemini AI]

    C ---|Metadata| G[Document Workflow]
    D ---|Large Files| G
    E ---|Clinical Scribe| H[Live Consultation]
```

### Core Architecture Components
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) — `'doctor'` or `'patient'` role enforced at both client and database level.
- **Primary Database**: Cloud Firestore with `onSnapshot` real-time listeners throughout — zero-latency queue and chat sync.
- **Hybrid Storage**: Firestore handles clinical metadata + online prescriptions; Appwrite Storage manages large medical files (DICOM/JPG/PDF).
- **Intelligence Layer**: Google Gemini API for AI chat assistant and planned clinical note generation.

## 🔐 Authentication & Routing

- **Firebase Auth** — Email/Password + **Google OAuth** (`GoogleAuthProvider`)
- On each load, `onAuthStateChanged` reads the user's `role` from `users/{uid}` in Firestore
- `ProtectedRoute` in `App.tsx` enforces strict role redirects — a doctor visiting a patient route is bounced to `/doctor` and vice versa

### Route Map

| Path | Role | Page |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | Public | Landing Page |
| `/login` `/signup` `/forgot-password` | Public | Auth Pages |
| `/solutions` `/features` `/about` `/pricing` etc. | Public | Marketing Pages |
| `/doctor` | Doctor | Doctor Dashboard |
| `/doctor/appointments` | Doctor | Appointment Manager |
| `/doctor/consultations` | Doctor | Chat Sessions |
| `/doctor/archive` | Doctor | Document Archive |
| `/doctor/settings` | Doctor | Profile & Settings |
| `/opd` | Doctor | OPD Queue Manager |
| `/workflow` | Doctor | Document Workflow |
| `/analytics` | Doctor | Clinical Intelligence |
| `/patient` | Patient | Patient Dashboard |
| `/patient/consultations` | Patient | My Chat Sessions |
| `/patient/archive` | Patient | My Medical Records |
| `/patient/settings` | Patient | Patient Profile |
| `/book` | Patient | Book Appointment |

## 🔥 Modules & Features

### 🖥️ Shared Shell — `DashboardLayout.tsx`
The wrapper around every authenticated page:

## 🗄️ Firebase Data Model

| Collection | Key Fields | Access Control |
|---|---|---|
| `users` | uid, email, firstName, lastName, role, specialty, licenseNumber, patientId, bloodType, allergies, photoURL | Owner only can write; all auth users can read |
| `appointments` | doctorId, patientId, doctorName, patientName, date, time, type, status, amount | Doctor or patient party only |
| `consultations` | doctorId, patientId, date, time, status | Doctor or patient party only |
| `records` | patientId, doctorId, name, type, category, appwriteFileId, appwriteViewUrl, prescriptionData, status | Patient owner or any doctor |
| `invoices` | patientId, doctorId, amount, status (Paid/Pending/Overdue) | Owning doctor only |
| `chats` | (message documents) | Any authenticated user |

---

## 🔒 Security Model

Security is enforced at the **database level** via `firestore.rules` — not just client-side:

- `isAuthenticated()` — base guard for every operation
- `isOwner(userId)` — UID must match the document's owner field
- `isDoctor()` / `isPatient()` — role verified via **live database lookup** on every write
- Field-level schema validation on every create/update: `isValidUser()`, `isValidAppointment()`, `isValidConsultation()`, `isValidRecord()`, `isValidInvoice()`
- **Role immutability**: `request.resource.data.role == resource.data.role` — a user cannot change their own role
